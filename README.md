##### also I have yearlies and the HSC coming up

A rewrite of my initial [reSentral React (+Cordova)](https://github.com/JumpyJacko/resentral-react-cordova) mobile app which aims to be faster and have more features due to writing with Flutter.

# About this Project
I honestly don't even know why. I've never coded with object-oriented programming and almost all of this code is from Flutter docs. This also runs off the same backend that the initial [reSentral React (+Cordova)](https://github.com/JumpyJacko/resentral-react-cordova) app so it's still slow.

Also decided to actually look at proper design inspirations when it was in it's second design phase. Design docs were made with Figma and can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HwetJzpdpT6fbwVp9CNSXf/reSentral-Flutter?node-id=30%3A118).
